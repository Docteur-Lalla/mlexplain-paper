  abstract = {This report details the design and implementation of the ZINC
system.  This is an experimental implementation of the ML
language, which has later evolved in the Caml Light system.
This system is strongly oriented toward separate compilation
and the production of small, standalone programs; type safety
is ensured by a Modula-2-like module system.  ZINC uses
simple, portable techniques, such as bytecode interpretation;
a sophisticated execution model helps counterbalance the
interpretation overhead.},
